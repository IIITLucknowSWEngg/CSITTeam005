## 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the software design for Duolingo, a gamified language-learning app. This document serves as a blueprint for the development team, detailing the architectural structure, data organization, and component functionalities needed to bring the system to life. It is also intended to provide clarity for stakeholders and future maintainers to understand how the app is designed to meet its goals.

## 1.2 Scope
Duolingo is a user-friendly, interactive app that uses gamification and adaptive learning techniques to help people learn languages at their own pace. It aims to make language learning fun, engaging, and accessible to users around the world. Key objectives include:
- *Gamified Learning*: Features like points, streaks, and leaderboards motivate users to stay consistent.
- *Personalized Experience*: Lessons are adapted to the user's progress and performance, ensuring effective learning.
- *Diverse Practice Options*: Exercises cover vocabulary, grammar, listening, and speaking to develop all-round skills.
- *Community Engagement*: Users can connect with others, compete in challenges, and share achievements.
- *Progress Tracking*: Provides detailed analytics on completed lessons, strengths, and areas for improvement. <br>
While the app offers a robust foundation for language learning, it is not a replacement for formal education or immersive real-world experiences.

## 1.3 Overview
This document is structured to guide the development of the Duolingo app. It includes:
- *System Overview*: A high-level description of the app’s functionality.
- *System Architecture*: The overall design, broken into logical modules.
- *Data Design*: Details on how user and course data is stored and managed.
- *Component Design*: A closer look at each core system component and how they work.
- *Human Interface Design*: Screens, interactions, and the overall user experience.
- *Requirements Matrix*: Mapping features to system components to ensure alignment.
