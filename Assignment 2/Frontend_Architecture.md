# Front-End Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the front-end architecture for the Duolingo clone project. It describes the technologies, component hierarchy, state management, and integration strategies.

---

## Technologies Used
1. **Framework:** React.js
2. **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
3. **State Management:** Redux
4. **API Communication:** REST APIs with Axios
5. **Real-Time Features:** WebSockets for live updates
6. **Mobile Integration:** A separate Flutter application for mobile users.

---

## Component Hierarchy
The application is modular and organized into the following components:

1. **Layout Components:**
   - **Header:** Includes navigation and user profile.
   - **Footer:** Contains quick links and copyright information.
   - **Sidebar:** Provides navigation for different modules.

2. **Feature Components:**
   - **Authentication:** Login, Signup, Password Reset.
   - **Learning Modules:**
     - **Lesson List:** Displays available lessons.
     - **Lesson View:** Shows lesson content with media and exercises.
     - **Quiz:** Interactive question/answer sessions.
   - **Progress Tracking:**
     - **Dashboard:** Charts and stats showing user progress.
   - **Gamification:**
     - Leaderboards, badges, and achievements.

3. **Reusable Components:**
   - Buttons, forms, input fields, modals, and alerts.

## State Management
- **Global State:** Redux will manage global states like user authentication, language preferences, and progress tracking.
- **Local State:** Reactâ€™s `useState` for small, component-specific data.
- **Data Flow:**
  - API data is fetched and stored in the Redux store.
  - Components subscribe to the store and re-render on updates.

---

## API Integration
- **REST APIs:**
  - Centralized Axios services for managing all API requests.
  - Example structure:
    ```js
    const fetchLessons = async () => {
      const response = await axios.get('/api/lessons');
      return response.data;
    };
    ```
- **WebSockets:**
  - Used for real-time progress updates (e.g., leaderboard ranking).
  - Example integration with `Socket.IO`:
    ```js
    const socket = io('http://localhost:4000');
    socket.on('update', (data) => {
      dispatch(updateProgress(data));
    });
    ```

---

## Responsive Design & Mobile App
- **Responsive Design:**
  - Tailwind CSS breakpoints ensure compatibility across devices.
  - Priority given to layouts adapting for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

- **Mobile Application:**
  - Flutter will replicate the core functionalities for native app experience.
  - Data shared via common APIs and WebSockets with the web platform.
