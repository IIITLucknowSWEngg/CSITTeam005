## 6. Use Cases  

### 6.1 Use Case 1: User Registration  

#### Happy Path  
- User enters valid details and successfully creates an account.  

#### Abuse Path  
- User attempts to register multiple fake accounts; system flags behavior and limits retries.  

#### Error Path  
- Network issues interrupt registration; the system provides retry options.  

### 6.2 Use Case 2: Lesson Completion  

#### Happy Path  
- User completes a lesson, earns XP, and sees progress update instantly.  

#### Abuse Path  
- User skips questions or attempts to exploit the system; the platform invalidates such progress and logs activity.  

#### Error Path  
- Connectivity issues cause progress to fail saving; the system queues data for upload once reconnected.  

### 6.3 Use Case 3: Subscription Management  

#### Happy Path  
- User successfully upgrades to a premium subscription and unlocks additional features.  

#### Abuse Path  
- User tries to bypass payment mechanisms; the system detects anomalies and suspends the account.  

#### Error Path  
- Transaction fails due to a payment gateway issue; the system provides alternative payment options.  

### 6.4 Use Case 4: Community Interaction  

#### Happy Path  
- User joins a group challenge and contributes to discussions.  

#### Abuse Path  
- User posts inappropriate content or spams forums; the system automatically flags content for review and applies penalties if necessary.  

#### Error Path  
- Group activity fails to load due to a server issue; the system notifies the user and provides a fallback option.
