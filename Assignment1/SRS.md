---

## 3. General System Requirements  

- Cross-platform compatibility (mobile and web).  
- Minimum server uptime of [99.9%](https://uptime.is/99.9).  
- Maximum lesson loading time of 2 seconds.    

---

## 4. Specific Requirements  

### 4.1 Functional Requirements  

1. **User Registration:** Support email, Google, and social platform sign-ups.  
2. **Adaptive Learning Paths:** Adjust content based on user performance.  
3. **Offline Learning:** Users can download lessons for offline use.  
4. **Progress Tracking:** Real-time sync of user progress across devices.  
5. **Interactive Quizzes:** Includes multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank exercises.  
6. **Community Interaction:** Group challenges and forums.  
7. **Notifications:** Customizable reminders for daily goals and streaks.  

### 4.2 Non-functional Requirements  

- **Performance:** Lessons must load within 2 seconds; system should support 10 million users concurrently.  
- **Security:** All stakeholder data must be encrypted during storage and transmission.  
- **Scalability:** Auto-scaling backend to handle peak times.  
- **Availability:** 99.9% uptime; progress saved in real-time to prevent data loss.  
- **Usability:** Intuitive design and accessibility features (e.g., text-to-speech).  

---

## 5. System Features  

- **Offline Learning:** Syncs progress upon reconnection.  
- **Adaptive Learning Path:** Adjusts content dynamically.  
- **Gamified Engagement:** Streaks, leaderboards, and XP for motivation.

## 6. Use Cases  

### 6.1 Use Case 1: User Registration  

#### Happy Path  
- User enters valid details and successfully creates an account.  

#### Abuse Path  
- User attempts to register multiple fake accounts; system flags behavior and limits retries.  

#### Error Path  
- Network issues interrupt registration; the system provides retry options.

  

### 6.2 Use Case 2: Lesson Completion  

#### Happy Path  
- User completes a lesson, earns XP, and sees progress update instantly.  

#### Abuse Path  
- User skips questions or attempts to exploit the system; the platform invalidates such progress and logs activity.  

#### Error Path  
- Connectivity issues cause progress to fail saving; the system queues data for upload once reconnected.  

### 6.3 Use Case 3: Community Interaction  

#### Happy Path  
- User joins a group challenge and contributes to discussions.  

#### Abuse Path  
- Content creator posts inappropriate content or user spams forums; the system automatically flags content for review and applies penalties if necessary.  

#### Error Path  
- Group activity fails to load due to a server issue; the system notifies the user and provides a fallback option.
