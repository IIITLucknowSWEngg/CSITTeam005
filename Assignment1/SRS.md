## 6. Use Cases  

### 6.1 Use Case 1: User Registration  

#### Happy Path  
- User enters valid details and successfully creates an account.  

#### Abuse Path  
- User attempts to register multiple fake accounts; system flags behavior and limits retries.  

#### Error Path  
- Network issues interrupt registration; the system provides retry options.

  

### 6.2 Use Case 2: Lesson Completion  

#### Happy Path  
- User completes a lesson, earns XP, and sees progress update instantly.  

#### Abuse Path  
- User skips questions or attempts to exploit the system; the platform invalidates such progress and logs activity.  

#### Error Path  
- Connectivity issues cause progress to fail saving; the system queues data for upload once reconnected.  

### 6.3 Use Case 3: Community Interaction  

#### Happy Path  
- User joins a group challenge and contributes to discussions.  

#### Abuse Path  
- Content creator posts inappropriate content or user spams forums; the system automatically flags content for review and applies penalties if necessary.  

#### Error Path  
- Group activity fails to load due to a server issue; the system notifies the user and provides a fallback option.

### 6.4 Use Case 4: Participation in Lessons  

#### Happy Path  
- User selects a lesson and successfully participates, completing tasks and earning points.  
- Progress is saved automatically, and the user sees feedback on performance.

#### Abuse Path  
- User tries to complete lessons in an unexpected way, such as spamming answers or using external tools to cheat.  
- System detects abnormal activity (e.g., unusually fast completion times) and flags the user's progress for review.

#### Error Path  
- The system encounters a technical error preventing lesson load.  
- User is informed of the issue and given an option to retry or continue with another lesson.

---

### 6.5 Use Case 5: Leaderboard Participation  

#### Happy Path  
- User’s performance in lessons and challenges is tracked, and they are ranked appropriately on the leaderboard.  
- User can see their progress and compare it with other learners.

#### Abuse Path  
- User attempts to manipulate or falsify progress to gain an unfair advantage on the leaderboard (e.g., using bots to complete lessons).  
- System detects suspicious patterns and automatically flags the account, initiating a review process.

#### Error Path  
- Server issues cause the leaderboard to fail to load.  
- The system alerts the user to the problem and provides a fallback, such as displaying cached leaderboard data or retrying after some time.

---

### 6.6 Use Case 6: Account Login  

#### Happy Path  
- User enters valid credentials (email/password or social login) and successfully logs into the platform.  
- System recognizes previous progress and displays relevant lessons.

#### Abuse Path  
- User enters incorrect login credentials multiple times, triggering the account lockout after several failed attempts.  
- The system provides a CAPTCHA or additional verification steps to prevent brute-force attacks.

#### Error Path  
- The system is unable to connect to the authentication service, causing login failure.  
- User is notified and provided with an option to try again or use an alternative login method (e.g., social login).

### 6.8 Use Case 8: Lesson Progress Tracking  

#### Happy Path  
- User successfully completes a lesson, and their progress is automatically updated in real-time across devices.  
- User is notified of new achievements, such as earning XP or reaching a milestone.

#### Abuse Path  
- User attempts to manipulate progress data using external tools or scripts.  
- The system detects abnormal activity (e.g., skipping questions or automated answers) and invalidates the progress, logging the event for review.

#### Error Path  
- Connectivity issues prevent progress from being saved.  
- The system queues the data for upload and notifies the user once the connection is restored.

---

### 6.9 Use Case 9: Social Features and Friend Interaction  

#### Happy Path  
- User sends a friend request, which is accepted, and they can now track each other’s progress and engage in challenges together.  
- User participates in group challenges and sees real-time updates from friends.
- 
#### Abuse Path  
- User attempts to manipulate the social features by creating multiple fake accounts to inflate their friend count or progress.  
- The system detects unusual patterns of account creation and interaction, temporarily suspending the user’s ability to send friend requests or participate in challenges until a review is completed.

#### Error Path  
- The system experiences a delay in sending or receiving friend requests.  
- The user is notified of the issue and given an option to retry.

---

### 6.10 Use Case 10: User Feedback and Rating  

#### Happy Path  
- User provides feedback or rates a lesson, contributing to continuous content improvement.  
- Feedback is collected and presented to relevant teams for review.

#### Abuse Path  
- User attempts to spam or provide fake reviews to manipulate content ratings.  
- The system uses pattern recognition to flag suspicious feedback and may prompt the user for additional verification.

#### Error Path  
- Feedback submission fails due to a server or connectivity issue.  
- The user is notified of the issue and given an option to retry or submit feedback later.
