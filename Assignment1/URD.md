
# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose of the Document

This User Requirements Document (URD) outlines the high-level requirements for the Duolingo-like language learning platform.
The document is intended for the project’s stakeholders, including end-users (learners), customers, development teams, and marketing representatives.
It aims to describe the platform's goals, system context, features, and constraints, ensuring alignment between stakeholders.
<!--SWEBOK 5.1: "This document (sometimes known as the user
requirements document or concept of operations
document) records the system requirements. It
defines the high-level system requirements from
the domain perspective. Its readership includes
representatives of the system users/customers
(marketing may play these roles for marketdriven software), so its content must be couched
in terms of the domain. The document lists the
system requirements along with background
information about the overall objectives for the
system, its target environment, and a statement of
the constraints, assumptions, and nonfunctional
requirements. It may include conceptual models
designed to illustrate the system context, usage
scenarios, and the principal domain entities, as
well as workflows."-->

## 1.2 Scope of the System

The system will provide an interactive, gamified environment where users can learn new languages.
It will focus on offering language lessons through a combination of quizzes, challenges, and spaced repetition techniques.
The primary user groups include learners of various proficiency levels, language teachers, and content creators.

## 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

Gamification: The application of game-design elements in non-game contexts.
SRS: Spaced Repetition System, a learning technique that involves increasing intervals of review.
XP: Experience Points, a measure of progress within the system.
